# 42184_AirbnbProject
Final project for the course of 42185 - Datascience for Mobility


The project consists of 3 parts:
- Prediction challenge (30%)
- Exploratory component (40%)
- Report (30%)

## Prediction
For the prediction challange, we should predict something based on the Copenhagen Airbnb data. Of course with explanations of what we are trying to predict, which model we use and why this model is a good fit, and model evaluation. Some visualisations can never hurt aswell.

## Exploratory component
Go out of our way to explore some aspect of Airbnb data that fits the course curriculum. It may be other data than just the airbnb data for copenhagen.

## Report
The report will be explainitory notebooks of our findings and work as a report. No overleaf documents, all Juoyter notebooks.
